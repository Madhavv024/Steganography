Steganography is the process of hiding a secret message which is text-based data within non-text files like image file, audio, video file etc. In such a way someone cannot know the presence of a hidden message in a particular file. The main purpose of Steganography is to maintain secret communication between two people. It generally refers to encoding and decoding. So in this image Steganography project, I have encoded and decoded the data into an image file.
